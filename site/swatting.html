<h2>Iraq Disabled Combat Veteran swatting attack adventure</h2>

<p>
On Mother’s Day, May 8, 2022, what should have been a quiet evening on Pueblo’s east side was shattered by a false police report that triggered a swatting attack. The video above captures the incident in real time.
</p>

<p>
Denver District Attorney Chief Deputy Mellissa Shopneck relied on the false police report to conceal a plea breach. After 162 days, her office failed to ensure that the due process of a contractual agreement was honored and performed. In cooperation with the Pueblo District Attorney’s Office, charges were dropped to reinforce the narrative in Denver that the only place I belong in society is in jail.
</p>

<p>
304 days after Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser refused to honor the plea deal promised by contract, the swatting attack was used to devastating effect. Chief Deputy District Attorney Mellissa Shopneck secured an arrest warrant, and I was held from June 30, 2022, until July 12, 2023. During that time, Senior Judge Judith Labuda kept me under separation for all status hearings, a tactic used to coerce me into accepting a plea deal that would absolve officials of their violations of my fundamental constitutional rights.

<h2>IRAQ</h2>
<p>I deployed to Iraq in 2003 with the 501st MI BN 1st BCT, 1st Armored Division as a 96R (Romeo), 
a Ground Surveillance Systems Operator, the military intelligence version of reconnaissance for the U.S. Army. My role was to track movement, interpret radar signatures, and provide frontline intelligence that shaped 
operations on the ground.</p>

    Iraq, 2003 — serving with the 1st Armored Division as a 96R (Ground Surveillance Systems Operator).

<p>My reconnaissance work was narrowly focused on high-value targets and weapons of mass destruction. 
Our Romeos were tasked with ensuring that counter-intelligence agents, interrogators, and their interpreters 
were protected during enhanced interrogation operations. we became responsible for handling detainees 
as part of our role.</p>

<p>
During a routine presence patrol escorting the XO of the 13th Cavalry Regiment, my convoy was struck by a 
daisy‑chained IED consisting of 16 linked explosives. The blast engulfed our vehicles and left me with injuries 
that I carry to this day. The coin I received from the 13th Cavalry — marked with crossed sabers, the number 13, 
and the motto “It Shall Be Done” — remains a reminder of both my service and the cost of that mission.

<p>It has been 1,263+ days since May 8, 2022, and I continue to fight to hold those accountable. 
This record stands as both testimony and evidence, a chronograph of service, sacrifice, and systemic failure 
that cannot be erased.</p>
