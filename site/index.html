      <h1>Systemic Conflict Convergence</h1>
      <h2>Central knowledge for conflict‑free justice</h2>

      <p class="small">
        SCC is a public‑interest academy and legal archive. Our mission is to help courts, lawyers,
        and the public recognize and resolve institutional conflicts that threaten the rights of indigent defendants.
        We document doctrine, define terms, and publish practical guidance to preserve fairness at every critical stage.
      </p>

      <p class="small">
        This site will serve as a single, reliable place to learn: what “conflict‑free counsel” requires,
        how imputation works across institutions, and why neutrality of prosecution and tribunal matters to due process.
        We aim to turn scattered filings into accessible doctrine and a durable public record.

<div class="sa30016oct-image">
  <img src="sa30016oct.jpg" alt="Colorado Supreme Court Order, Case No. 2025SA300, October 16, 2025">
</div>

<h1>Colorado Supreme Court</h1>
<h2>2025SA300 Questions Presented:</h2>
<p>
  1. <strong>Public Defender Conflict.</strong><br>
  Whether the Sixth Amendment is violated when the Colorado State Public
  Defender’s Office continues to represent a defendant while its statewide leadership
  is simultaneously defending the Office against that same defendant’s conflict‑of‑
  interest claims, creating an imputed, irreconcilable conflict under Colo. RPC 1.7
  and 1.10.
</p>
<p>
  2. <strong>Prosecutorial Conflict.</strong><br>
  Whether due process is violated when the District Attorney’s Office, having
  declined to investigate or prosecute a demonstrably false police report another
  District Attorney’s Office used to secure an arrest warrant and over a year of
  pretrial custody, turns around to charge the defendant with misdemeanor
  obstruction of governmental operations based on petitioner’s alleged
  communications demanding accountability for that same unaddressed misconduct,
  thereby wielding the criminal process to punish a legitimate challenge to the
  prosecution’s own unresolved conflict of Melissa Shopneck maliciously
  prosecuting now‑dismissed charges while under conflict with a sitting judge her
  office regularly does business in front of.
</p>
<p>
  3. <strong>Judicial Conflict.</strong><br>
  Whether due process is violated when the presiding judge conducts ex parte
  communications with the District Attorney’s Office and prospective defense
  counsel about the defendant’s mental competency before any counsel is formally
  appointed and without an on‑the‑record conflict inquiry, even as parallel
  proceedings in Denver District Court challenge unrecorded, weaponized
  competency conflicts, thereby signaling prejudgment and denying the defendant an
  impartial tribunal.
</p>
<p>
  4. <strong>Systemic Conflict Convergence.</strong><br>
  Whether the convergence of these structural conflicts, conflicted defense
  counsel under the Sixth Amendment, conflicted prosecution under due process,
  and a conflicted tribunal under <em>Caperton</em>, so eviscerates the adversarial process
  and denies the defendant’s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights that it creates
  a systemic breakdown of the criminal justice system, presenting a question of first
  impression requiring this Court’s original supervisory intervention.
</p>
<p>
  5. <strong>Indigent Defendant Equal Protection and Due Process.</strong><br>
  Whether indigent defendants are denied equal protection and due process
  when structural conflicts infect the only counsel available, the Colorado State
  Public Defender’s Office, while non‑indigent defendants can secure private,
  conflict‑free representation “commensurate with that available to non‑indigent
  defendants,” in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
</p>
<p>
  6. <strong>Veteran Leniency &amp; ADA Accommodations.</strong><br>
  Whether due process and equal protection are violated when courts and
  prosecutors disregard a combat veteran’s military service, trauma, and
  VA‑documented disabilities, and instead deny diversion or accommodations
  required by federal law, contrary to the U.S. Supreme Court’s recognition that our
  Nation has a long tradition of affording leniency to veterans (<em>Porter v. McCollum</em>,
  558 U.S. 30, 43–44 (2009) (per curiam)) and the mandates of Title II of the
  Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12134; 28 C.F.R.
  § 35.130(a).
</p>
<p>
  7. <strong>Breach of Federal NPA and State Plea Agreement.</strong><br>
  Whether due process is violated when a federal non‑prosecution agreement
  conditioned on a state plea collapses because the State breaches the plea within
  days of execution and provides no remedy for years, leaving the defendant without
  the benefit of the bargain, in contravention of <em>Santobello v. New York</em>, 404 U.S.
  257, 262–63 (1971), which held that when a plea rests in any significant degree on
  a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, such promise must be fulfilled, and in
  violation of the constitutional guarantee of fundamental fairness in plea bargaining.
</p>

<p>
  8. <strong>Impossibility and Illusory Plea.</strong><br>
  Whether due process is violated when the State induces a guilty plea by
  promising diversionary programs or treatment courts that do not exist, rendering
  the plea involuntary and illusory under the Fourteenth Amendment and the
  Supreme Court’s plea‑bargaining jurisprudence, including <em>Mabry v. Johnson</em>,
  467 U.S. 504, 507–11 (1984), holding that a guilty plea must be voluntary,
  knowing, and not induced by unfulfilled promises, and <em>Santobello v. New York</em>,
  404 U.S. 257, 262–63 (1971), recognizing that when a plea rests in any significant
  degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, such promise must be
  fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
  9. <strong>Conflict‑Free Counsel and Abandonment.</strong><br>
  Whether the Sixth Amendment is violated when indigent defendants are
  compelled to proceed with counsel who withdraws for private gain, conceals
  conflicts of interest, or refuses to present the defendant’s chosen defense, thereby
  depriving the accused of conflict‑free representation and constituting structural
  error under <em>Holloway v. Arkansas</em>, 435 U.S. 475, 481–91 (1978), holding that
  forcing joint representation over timely objection requires automatic reversal
  because prejudice is presumed; <em>Strickland v. Washington</em>, 466 U.S. 668, 687–96
  (1984), establishing that ineffective assistance requires deficient performance and
  resulting prejudice undermining confidence in the outcome; and <em>People v.
  Bergerud</em>, 223 P.3d 686, 693–96 (Colo. 2010), recognizing that forcing a defendant
  to choose between counsel and the presentation of his chosen defense violates the
  right to counsel and fundamental trial rights.
</p>
<p>
  10. <strong>Judicial Bias and Competency Weaponization.</strong><br>
  Whether due process is violated when the presiding judge, before appointing
  counsel, engages in ex parte communications with the very public defender’s
  office the defendant has identified as conflicted, and in those communications
  suggests a competency evaluation, thereby prejudicing prospective counsel and
  weaponizing competency proceedings to delay, silence, and suppress defense, in
  violation of <em>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.</em>, 556 U.S. 868, 876–87 (2009),
  holding that due process requires recusal where, under a realistic appraisal of
  psychological tendencies and human weakness, the probability of actual bias is too
  high to be constitutionally tolerable; and <em>Pate v. Robinson</em>, 383 U.S. 375,
  378–86 (1966), holding that the conviction of a legally incompetent defendant
  violates due process and that courts must sua sponte conduct a competency
  hearing when evidence raises a bona fide doubt.
</p>


<p>
  11. <strong>Brady Violations and Weaponized False Reports.</strong><br>
  Whether due process is violated when the prosecution suppresses
  exculpatory evidence and relies on demonstrably false police reports and dismissed
  allegations to justify arrest, bond revocation, and competency proceedings,
  contrary to <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>, 373 U.S. 83, 86–88 (1963), holding that
  suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused violates due
  process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment; and
  <em>Thompson v. Clark</em>, 596 U.S. ___, ___, 142 S. Ct. 1332, 1335–36 (2022),
  holding that a criminal case terminates favorably for the accused when it ends
  without a conviction, underscoring the constitutional bar against weaponizing
  baseless charges once dismissed.
</p>


<p>
  12. <strong>First Amendment Retaliation and Chilling Effect.</strong><br>
  Whether the First Amendment permits criminalizing a citizen’s speech, even
  harsh or extreme speech, including alleged “true threats,” when that speech
  criticizes judicial and prosecutorial misconduct and arises as the only available
  means of resisting a Systemic Conflict Convergence; and whether charges and
  competency proceedings imposed in retaliation for such speech violate the
  recklessness standard required by <em>Counterman v. Colorado</em>, 600 U.S. 66,
  72–73 (2023), holding that the First Amendment requires proof that the speaker
  had some subjective understanding of the threatening nature of the statement,
  with recklessness as the minimum standard, and the constitutional guarantees of
  free expression under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
</p>


<p>
  13. <strong>Cumulative Structural Breakdown.</strong><br>
  Whether the convergence of a breached federal non‑prosecution agreement, a
  breached state plea, conflicted defense counsel, conflicted prosecution, and a
  conflicted tribunal constitutes a systemic breakdown of the adversarial process,
  creating structural error that is not susceptible to harmless‑error review and
  requiring this Court’s supervisory intervention to preserve the integrity of criminal
  justice, in light of <em>Arizona v. Fulminante</em>, 499 U.S. 279, 309–10 (1991),
  distinguishing between trial errors subject to harmless‑error review and structural
  defects affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds; <em>United States v.
  Gonzalez‑Lopez</em>, 548 U.S. 140, 148–50 (2006), holding that denial of the right to
  counsel of choice is structural error not subject to harmless‑error analysis; and
  <em>Weaver v. Massachusetts</em>, 582 U.S. 286, 294–95 (2017), reaffirming that certain
  errors are structural because they undermine the fairness of the entire proceeding.
</p>


<p>
  14. <strong>Speedy Trial Violation.</strong><br>
  Whether petitioner’s statutory and constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated
  when the prosecution and court failed to bring him to trial within the 90‑day
  deadline mandated by C.R.S. § 18‑1‑405 and the Sixth Amendment, and when
  conflicted counsel failed to preserve the violation, compounding the deprivation of
  liberty and foreclosing meaningful review, in contravention of <em>People v. Taylor</em>,
  2020 COA 79, ¶¶ 25–34, holding that dismissal is required when the government
  fails to meet statutory speedy trial deadlines; <em>People v. DeGreat</em>, 2020 CO 25,
  ¶¶ 1–4, 461 P.3d 11, 13–14 (Colo. 2020), holding that the duty to comply with
  Colorado’s speedy trial statute rests with the prosecution and the court, not the
  defendant; and <em>Huang v. County Court</em>, 98 P.3d 924, 927 (Colo. App. 2004),
  holding that “the speedy trial period is calculated separately for each criminal
  complaint” and that dismissed charges are a nullity, with a new speedy trial period
  beginning upon refiling, even if the charges are identical, citing <em>People v. Allen</em>,
  885 P.2d 207 (Colo. 1994), and <em>Meehan v. County Court</em>, 762 P.2d 725 (Colo.
  App. 1988).
</p>

<p>
  15. <strong>Denial of Access to Courts.</strong><br>
  Whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments are violated when an
  indigent, pro se defendant is denied the basic tools of defense, subpoenas,
  investigative assistance, phone calls, and uncensored legal mail, so that he cannot
  prepare or present his case, thereby extinguishing the constitutional right of access
  to the courts, in contravention of <em>Bounds v. Smith</em>, 430 U.S. 817, 821–25 (1977),
  holding that the fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts requires
  states to provide prisoners with adequate law libraries or legal assistance; and
  <em>Lewis v. Casey</em>, 518 U.S. 343, 351–53 (1996), clarifying that denial of access to
  legal resources or assistance violates the Constitution when it frustrates a
  prisoner’s ability to bring a non‑frivolous legal claim.
</p>
<p>
  16. <strong>Cruel and Unusual Pretrial Detention.</strong><br>
  Whether the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments are violated when a
  disabled combat veteran is subjected to prolonged pretrial detention under
  retaliatory and restrictive conditions, including isolation, denial of
  accommodations, and weaponized competency proceedings, thereby imposing
  impermissible punishment before conviction, contrary to <em>Bell v. Wolfish</em>,
  441 U.S. 520, 535–39 (1979), holding that under the Due Process Clause, a
  pretrial detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt, and that
  conditions or restrictions that are not reasonably related to a legitimate
  governmental objective constitute impermissible punishment; and
  <em>Kingsley v. Hendrickson</em>, 576 U.S. 389, 396–97 (2015), holding that pretrial
  detainees’ constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment are
  violated when officials impose conditions or use force that is objectively
  unreasonable, regardless of subjective intent.
</p>
<p>
  17. <strong>Double Jeopardy, Collateral Estoppel, and Interdependent Plea Collapse.</strong><br>
  Whether due process, double‑jeopardy, and collateral‑estoppel principles are
  violated when state prosecutors sequence a misdemeanor charge to extend time for
  a federal indictment, dismiss that charge once federal prosecution commences,
  then enter a federal non‑prosecution agreement conditioned on a state plea the
  State knows it cannot perform, and, after breaching that plea and concealing the
  breach for years, revive restraints and consequences despite the federal resolution,
  thereby weaponizing dual sovereignty and plea interdependence to circumvent
  constitutional protections, in contravention of <em>Ashe v. Swenson</em>, 397 U.S. 436,
  443–46 (1970), holding that collateral estoppel is embodied in the Double
  Jeopardy Clause and bars relitigation of an issue necessarily decided in the
  defendant’s favor; <em>Bravo‑Fernandez v. United States</em>, 580 U.S. 5, 12–14 (2016),
  reaffirming that acquittals have preclusive effect even when accompanied by
  inconsistent verdicts; and <em>Santobello v. New York</em>, 404 U.S. 257, 262–63 (1971),
  holding that when a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise of the
  prosecutor, such promise must be fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
  18. <strong>Forced Medication / Inadequate Mental Health Care.</strong><br>
  Whether the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, together with Title II of
  the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, are violated when state custodial staff
  administer harmful and contraindicated medications, simultaneously withhold
  effective, court‑authorized treatment, and layer multiple inappropriate drugs at
  once, while erasing documented disability accommodations, creating an escalating
  cycle of retaliation and neglect in response to grievances and abuse complaints;
  and whether such practices, carried out amid acknowledged facility staffing crises
  and withdrawn but coercive involuntary‑medication petitions, impose
  unconstitutional punishment and deny minimally adequate care and liberty,
  contrary to <em>Estelle v. Gamble</em>, 429 U.S. 97, 103–04 (1976), holding that deliberate
  indifference to serious medical needs constitutes cruel and unusual punishment
  under the Eighth Amendment; <em>Farmer v. Brennan</em>, 511 U.S. 825, 834–37 (1994),
  clarifying that officials act with deliberate indifference when they know of and
  disregard an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; and <em>Washington v. Harper</em>,
  494 U.S. 210, 221–22 (1990), holding that the Due Process Clause limits the
  State’s ability to administer antipsychotic drugs against a prisoner’s will, requiring
  procedural protections and medical justification.
</p>
<p>
  19. <strong>HIPAA / Privacy Breaches.</strong><br>
  Whether constitutional privacy, due process, and equal protection are
  violated when a defendant is court‑ordered into treatment and protected medical
  and federal case information is unlawfully disclosed in violation of HIPAA; when
  that breach is then used to accelerate a federal non‑prosecution agreement and
  state plea; and when, after the State breaches the plea and conceals the breach for
  years, the original HIPAA violation is weaponized against the defendant as
  evidence of “conspiracy theories,” thereby silencing him while Systemic Conflict
  Convergence suppresses a powder keg of public trust, contrary to <em>Whalen v. Roe</em>,
  429 U.S. 589, 599–600 (1977), recognizing a constitutional interest in avoiding
  disclosure of personal medical information; and <em>NASA v. Nelson</em>, 562 U.S. 134,
  138–39 (2011), assuming the existence of a constitutional right to informational
  privacy but relying on statutory safeguards such as HIPAA to protect it.
</p>
<p>
  20. <strong>Custody‑Enabled Exploitation / Property Loss.</strong><br>
  Whether the Constitution is violated when, during pretrial custody, a
  defendant’s vehicle and financial assets are seized, transferred, and sold without
  notice or hearing, contrary to <em>Fuentes v. Shevin</em>, 407 U.S. 67, 80–82 (1972),
  requiring notice and opportunity to be heard before deprivation of property; and
  <em>United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property</em>, 510 U.S. 43, 53–55 (1993),
  holding that absent exigent circumstances, due process requires notice and hearing
  before property seizure, losses that would have been avoided had conflict‑free
  counsel safeguarded his rights, but instead went unchallenged because the Public
  Defender’s Office, entangled in Systemic Conflict Convergence, prioritized
  institutional self‑protection over the client, thereby violating the Sixth Amendment
  right to conflict‑free representation recognized in <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan</em>, 446 U.S.
  335, 348–50 (1980), and reducing not only property rights but the full spectrum of
  constitutional guarantees, present and future, to collateral casualties of custody.
</p>
<p>
  21. <strong>Forfeiture of Counsel Without Valid Waiver.</strong><br>
  Whether the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments are violated when a trial court
  effectuates a forfeiture of the right to counsel by compelling a defendant to proceed
  pro se without conducting a full, on‑the‑record <em>Arguello</em>/<em>Faretta</em> inquiry into the
  defendant’s understanding, capacity, and voluntariness; and whether such a
  forfeiture is constitutionally invalid where contemporaneous Systemic Conflict
  Convergence exists, thereby rendering any purported waiver neither knowing,
  voluntary, nor intelligent, contrary to <em>Faretta v. California</em>, 422 U.S. 806, 835
  (1975), requiring a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel; <em>Iowa v. Tovar</em>,
  541 U.S. 77, 88–89 (2004), requiring trial courts to ensure defendants understand
  the dangers of self‑representation; <em>Johnson v. Zerbst</em>, 304 U.S. 458, 464–65
  (1938), holding that waiver must be an intentional relinquishment of a known
  right; and <em>People v. Arguello</em>, 772 P.2d 87, 93–94 (Colo. 1989), requiring a full
  inquiry into capacity and voluntariness; and whether such a forfeiture constitutes
  structural error not subject to harmless‑error review under <em>United States v.
  Gonzalez‑Lopez</em>, 548 U.S. 140, 150 (2006).
</p>
<p>
  22. <strong>Denial of Records and Evidence as Institutional Suppression.</strong><br>
  Whether due process and the right of access to the courts are violated when
  the court and prosecution fail or refuse to provide transcripts, discovery, and seized
  defense evidence (including unsearched or unreturned digital evidence), thereby
  preventing meaningful preparation, investigation, and presentation of the defense;
  and whether such omissions, far from neutral error, operate as deliberate acts of
  institutional self‑protection designed to shield and perpetuate Systemic Conflict
  Convergence, contrary to <em>Griffin v. Illinois</em>, 351 U.S. 12, 18–19 (1956), holding
  that denial of transcripts to indigent defendants violates due process and equal
  protection; <em>Britt v. North Carolina</em>, 404 U.S. 226, 227–28 (1971), requiring
  transcripts when necessary for an effective defense; <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>, 373 U.S.
  83, 87 (1963), holding that suppression of favorable evidence violates due process;
  and <em>Bounds v. Smith</em>, 430 U.S. 817, 828 (1977), recognizing the fundamental
  right of access to courts.
</p>
<p>
  23. <strong>Judicial Vindictiveness in Response to Assertions of Systemic Conflict Convergence.</strong><br>
  Whether due process is violated when judicial actions, such as initiating or
  encouraging competency evaluations, restricting communication, or imposing
  adverse case‑management rulings, are taken in direct response to a defendant’s
  protected advocacy and explicit assertions of Systemic Conflict Convergence,
  thereby creating the appearance of retaliatory motive, institutional self‑protection,
  and compromising the constitutional guarantee of an impartial tribunal, contrary to
  <em>In re Murchison</em>, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955), holding that a fair trial in a fair
  tribunal is a basic requirement of due process; <em>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.</em>,
  556 U.S. 868, 872 (2009), holding that due process is violated where the probability
  of bias is constitutionally intolerable; <em>Tumey v. Ohio</em>, 273 U.S. 510, 523 (1927),
  holding that judicial interest in the outcome violates due process; and
  <em>North Carolina v. Pearce</em>, 395 U.S. 711, 725 (1969), holding that judicial
  vindictiveness in response to the exercise of rights violates due process.
</p>

  24. <strong>Denial of Liberal Construction and Judicial Accountability.</strong><br>
  Whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments are violated when the
  Colorado Supreme Court, in 2025SA130, refuses to apply the settled rule that pro
  se pleadings must be liberally construed, thereby extinguishing petitioner’s
  constitutional claims on technical grounds and confirming that even the guardians
  of justice have chosen silence over accountability, contrary to <em>Haines v. Kerner</em>,
  404 U.S. 519, 520–21 (1972), holding that pro se pleadings are to be held to less
  stringent standards than those drafted by lawyers; <em>Boag v. MacDougall</em>, 454 U.S.
  364, 365 (1982) (per curiam), summarily reversing for failure to liberally construe
  a pro se complaint; and <em>Erickson v. Pardus</em>, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007), reaffirming
  that liberal construction is required to ensure access to courts and protection of
  constitutional rights, as well as the broader principle of access to courts recognized
  in <em>Bounds v. Smith</em>, 430 U.S. 817, 828 (1977).
